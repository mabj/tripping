# Amsterdam

## Genral Tips

- Amsterdam is organized in rings ([map](https://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/i/aa/2018/06/amsterdam_map.pdf)). 
- The main rings are composed by these streets: Singel, Herengracht, Kaizergratcht and Prinsengracht.
- The center of the rings is Amsterdam Central (train station);
- There are trams (superficie metro) connecting all neighbohoods to the central station;
- There is a 24 hours tram ticket (9,50 EURs as 22nd Sep);
- You can buy this ticket inside the tram.
- There are also 3 subways lines (undergrounds).
- There are ferry boats connecting the central station to Amsterdam Nood (crossing the IJ river);

## Things to do
