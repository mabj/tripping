## Loops

### Loop 1 - De Pijp -> Amsterdam Central

<pre>
De Pijp and Albert Cuyp Market -> Museum Plein -> Vondelpark -> Leindsplein -> Joordan -> Spui -> Dam Square -> Central Station
</pre>

When arriving in the Central Station: 
- If it is still early (before 1 PM) - go visit **NDSM**;  
- If it is end of the afternoon (before sunseting) - do the boat trip through the canals;  
- If it is evening already - grab a beer at BeerTemple and do a walk through the Red Light District;  

### Loop 2 - Amsterdam Oost -> IJBurg

From the Central Station you can take the tram number `#26` and go to one of the newest areas in Amsterdam: IJBurg. They a literally pumping sand from the bottom of the ocean and expanding the city from scratch. It is a interesting residential area to visit.

### Loop 3 - Amsterdam Oost -> Muiden (Bike - 13km - one-way)

A nice adventure is to cycle from Amsterdam to a neighboring city called Muiden. There is a small 13th-century castle ([Muiden Castle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S9MyAwNug5iSYoJ48)) and a bunch of small restaurants and bars. It is a very pleasant ride.

### Loop 4 - Amsterdam -> Zaanse Schans (Bike - 19km - one-way)

You can do this trip the easy way and the less-easy way. 

- Easy way: Take a train at the Central Station to Zaanse Schans station. On the way back take another train to Zaandam Central.
- less-easy way: rent a bicycle and go from Amsterdam to Zaanse Schans cycling. I find the route to there more beautiful than the end destination :D. 

You can return to Amsterdam by train (and carry the bike inside the train: 9EURs).

This is the best route:
